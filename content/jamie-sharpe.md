### First Steps

At a very ealy age Jamie developed a passion for music that started with his parents giving him his first drum set at the age of eight. This passion grew as he joined Marching Band at his local highschool.

### Hitting The Road

Fueled by his heart for music Jamie joined a band called **Rush Of Fools** and hit the road touring and playing for festivals, churches, and camps. Their first single released went straight to the top of the Christian Music charts and Radio Channels. Jamie spent the next ten years playing for thousands of people all over the United States and even toured in Europe. In 2016 after honing his craft and musical talents Jamie felt that it was time to for a new chapter in his life.

### A Dream Is Born

After coming off the road Jamie began planning his next chapter, building his own recording studio. The studio location in a small town in Alabama is perfect for bands and artists looking to get away from distractions so they can focus their creativity. The tracking room provides ample space for full bands and creative vibes for the singer songwriter. At Hartwell your creativity and uniqueness are focused and refined to produce a sound that is unforgettable.
