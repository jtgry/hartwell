As a professional musician, touring artist and having a love of creating music for over 20 years, I have always felt there was a need for guiding other drummers to help cultivate their musicianship and shape their abilities. Our studio offers ample space, equipment, and 1-on-1 instruction during your private lesson.

**Novice** - Learn the basics of drumming to start your journey in the world of music.

**Intermediate** - Perfect your skills with new techniques while adding your own personality to playing.

**Advanced** - You’ve got the playing down. I’ll help you develop creative new ways to keep your drumming and practicing proficient.
